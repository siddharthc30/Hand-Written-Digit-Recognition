# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains three different .ipnb files which solve the same task but in three different ways.

1. Digit_recognition.ipynb file consists of a logistic regression model which I just did because I wanted toi know how much accuracy I can get using logistic regression and the results were not bad. The model is about 95% accurate.(I did not use this for testing because I only wanted to know the accuray of a logistic regression model for this dataset)

2. digit recogniser using neural network.ipynb file contains a neural network model.This model contains a Standard Neural network for the kaggle digit recogniser dataset,
it has an accuracy around 90% which is cool for a standard NN used to train on a image dataset.

3.Digit recogniser using cnn.ipynb file has my best model for the kaggle digit recogniser dataset.This is Convolutional Neural Network model and gave a accuracy of 99.04% on my validation set and 99.27% on my test set.
